# music

This repository holds music and general information about Chinese instruments (Dizi, Erhu, Guzheng).

Basically, this is my personal notes for while I learn to play (since most resources are, well, in Chinese and I can only read English).

# Dizi (Chinese Bamboo Flute)

[![14. Dizi (Chinese bamboo flute) - Painted Heart](https://img.youtube.com/vi/tuHiYjamHbE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuHiYjamHbE)

This is a bit like other Bamboo flutes except it has a very thin paper membrane covering one hole, which causes it to produce a buzzing noise (sounds somewhere inbetween a recorder and a kazoo, depending on how taunt you glue the membrane on).

- See my notes in the [Dizi folder](https://github.com/slimsag/music/blob/master/dizi/index.md#dizi).

# Erhu (Chinese violin)

[![Tokyo Ghoul OP 「Unravel」with erhu](https://img.youtube.com/vi/bcDvjh9xbXo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcDvjh9xbXo)

Basically a Chinese version of the Violin, except it only has one string and is pushed a bit like a guitar to produce a quite broad range of noise quite like the human voice.

# Guzheng (Chinese... pluck board..?)
