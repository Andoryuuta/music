# music

This repository holds music and general information about Chinese instruments (Dizi, Erhu, Guzheng).

Basically, this is my personal notes for while I learn to play (since most resources are, well, in Chinese and I can only read English).



- [Learn about the Dizi / Qudi](https://github.com/slimsag/music/blob/master/dizi/index.md#dizi)
- ~~Learn about the Erhu~~ (mine hasn't arrived from Singapore yet :( )
- ~~Learn about the Guzheng~~ (mine hasn't arrived from Beijing yet :( )
